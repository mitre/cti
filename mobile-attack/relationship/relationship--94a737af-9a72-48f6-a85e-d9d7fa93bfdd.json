            "description": "Application vetting techniques could (either statically or dynamically) look for indications that the application downloads and executes new code at runtime (e.g., on Android use of DexClassLoader, System.load, or the WebView JavaScriptInterface capability, or on iOS use of JSPatch or similar capabilities). Unfortunately, this is only a partial mitigation, as additional scrutiny would still need to be applied to applications that use these techniques, as the techniques are often used without malicious intent, and because applications may employ other techniques such as to hide their use of these techniques."
