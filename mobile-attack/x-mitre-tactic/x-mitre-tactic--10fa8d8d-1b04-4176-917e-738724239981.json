            "description": "The adversary is trying to steal data.\n\nExfiltration refers to techniques and attributes that result or aid in the adversary removing files and information from the targeted mobile device.\n\nIn the mobile environment, mobile devices are frequently connected to networks outside enterprise control such as cellular networks or public Wi-Fi networks. Adversaries could attempt to evade detection by communicating on these networks, and potentially even by using non-Internet Protocol mechanisms such as Short Message Service (SMS). However, cellular networks often have data caps and/or extra data charges that could increase the potential for adversarial communication to be detected.",
