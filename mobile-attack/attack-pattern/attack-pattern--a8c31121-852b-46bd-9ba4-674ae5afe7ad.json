During normal device usage, users often provide credentials to various locations, such as login pages/portals or system dialog boxes. Input capture mechanisms may be transparent to the user (e.g. [Keylogging](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1417/001)) or rely on deceiving the user into providing input into what they believe to be a genuine application prompt (e.g. [GUI Input Capture](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1417/002)).",
