An adversary could deliberately insert malicious behavior or could exploit inadvertent vulnerabilities.\n\nFor example, Ryan Welton of NowSecure identified exploitable remote code execution vulnerabilities in a third-party advertisement library (Citation: NowSecure-RemoteCode). Grace et al. identified security issues in mobile advertisement libraries (Citation: Grace-Advertisement).",
