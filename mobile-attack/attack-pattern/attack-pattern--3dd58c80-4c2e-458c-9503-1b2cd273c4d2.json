            "description": "At least three methods exist to perform User Interface Spoofing:\n\nFirst, on both Android and iOS, an adversary could impersonate the user interface of a legitimate app or device function to trick a user into entering account credentials. \n\nSecond, on both Android and iOS, a malicious app could impersonate the identity of another app in order to trick users into installing and using it.\n\nThird, on older versions of Android, a malicious app could abuse mobile operating system features to interfere with a running legitimate app as described in  (Citation: Felt-PhishingOnMobileDevices) and  (Citation: Hassell-ExploitingAndroid). However, this technique appears to have been addressed starting in Android 5.0 with the deprecation of the Android's ActivityManager.getRunningTasks method and modification of its behavior (Citation: Android-getRunningTasks) and further addressed in Android 5.1.1 (Citation: StackOverflow-getRunningAppProcesses) to prevent a malicious app from determining what app is currently in the foreground.\n\nPlatforms: Android, iOS",
