            "description": "An iOS application may be able to maliciously claim a URL scheme, allowing it to intercept calls that are meant for a different application. This technique, for example, could be used to capture OAuth authorization codes as described in  (Citation: IETF-PKCE) or to phish user credentials as described in  (Citation: MobileIron-XARA). Related potential security implications are described in  (Citation: Dhanjani-URLScheme). FireEye researchers describe URL scheme hijacking in a blog post (Citation: FireEye-Masque2), including evidence of its use.\n\nPlatforms: iOS",
