Users should be advised to use extreme caution before granting this authorization when it is requested.\n* Abusing accessibility features. On Android, adversaries may abuse accessibility features to record keystrokes by registering an `AccessibilityService` class, overriding the `onAccessibilityEvent` method, and listening for the `AccessibilityEvent.TYPE_VIEW_TEXT_CHANGED` event type. The event object passed into the function will contain the data that the user typed. \n*Additional methods of keylogging may be possible if root access is available. \n",
