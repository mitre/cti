Mobile operating systems have means to subscribe to events such as receiving an SMS message, device boot completion, or other device activities. \n\nAdversaries may abuse these mechanisms as a means of maintaining persistent access to a victim via automatically and repeatedly executing malicious code. After gaining access to a victim\u2019s system, adversaries may create or modify event triggers to point to malicious content that will be executed whenever the event trigger is invoked. ",
