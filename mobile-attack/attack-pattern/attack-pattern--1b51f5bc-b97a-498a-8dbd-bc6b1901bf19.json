On Android versions prior to 7, applications can obtain this information by executing the <code>ps</code> command, or by examining the <code>/proc</code> directory. Starting in Android version 7, use of the Linux kernel's <code>hidepid</code> feature prevents applications (without escalated privileges) from accessing this information (Citation: Android-SELinuxChanges).",
