            "description": "As described by [Drive-by Compromise](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1189), a drive-by compromise is when an adversary gains access to a system through a user visiting a website over the normal course of browsing. With this technique, the user's web browser is targeted for exploitation. For example, a website may contain malicious media content intended to exploit vulnerabilities in media parsers as demonstrated by the Android Stagefright vulnerability  (Citation: Zimperium-Stagefright).\n\n(This technique was formerly known as Malicious Web Content. It has been renamed to better align with ATT&CK for Enterprise.)",
