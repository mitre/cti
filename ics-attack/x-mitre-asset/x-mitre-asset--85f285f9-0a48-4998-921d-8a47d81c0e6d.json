            "description": "A Distributed Control System (DCS) Controller is a microprocessor unit that is used to manage automation processes. DCS Controllers are often found in plants (chemical, manufacturing, oil and gas, etc.) where large scale continuous automation processes are required. A DCS Controller typically operates as part of a larger networked system with other DCS Controllers where each DCS Controller manages an individual part of a continuous process. In addition to these other controllers, DCS Controllers operate along side multiple other system components including system software, operator stations, and other embedded field controllers. The distributed nature of DCS Controllers provides scalability, redundancy, and improved process reliability. DCS Controllers are programmed using traditional process automation programming languages (IEC-61131). ",
