PACs are designed to enable automation applications across integrated software applications, peer controllers (e.g., PLC), Human Machine Interfaces, and other systems. PACs often include advanced features for process control, motion control, drive control, and vision applications. PACs are programmed using traditional process automation programming languages (IEC-61131) and sometimes languages such as C and C++ to support more advanced controls.",
