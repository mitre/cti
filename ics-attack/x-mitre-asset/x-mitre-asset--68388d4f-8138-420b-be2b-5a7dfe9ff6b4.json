Different types of data gateways are used to perform various functions, including:\n\n *  <u>Protocol Translation:</u> Enable communication to devices that support different or incompatible protocols by translating information from one protocol to another. \n *  <u>Media Converter:</u> Convert data across different Layer 1 and 2 network protocols / mediums, for example, converting from Serial to Ethernet. \n *  <u>Data Aggregation:</u> Collect and combine data from different devices into one consistent format and protocol interface. \n*  <u>Data Mirroring:</u> Create a real-time, exact copy of data streams from devices to a separate destination for redundancy, monitoring, or backup purposes.\n\nData gateways are often critical to the forwarding/transmission of critical control or monitoring data within the ICS. Further, these devices often have remote various network services that are used to communicate across different zones or networks.  \n\nThese assets may focus on a single function listed below or combinations of these functions to best fit the industry use-case. \n",
