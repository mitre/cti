As noted in the technique description, there may be multiple sources of alarms in an ICS environment. Discrepancies between alarms may indicate the adversary is suppressing some but not all the alarms in the environment.  This will not directly detect the technique\u2019s execution, but instead may provide additional evidence that the technique has been used and may complement other detections.",
