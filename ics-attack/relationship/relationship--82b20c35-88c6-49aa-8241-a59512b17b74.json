A willing insider or unknown third party, such as a contractor, may have brought the removable media into the target environment. (Citation: Nicolas Falliere, Liam O Murchu, Eric Chien February 2011) The earliest version of Stuxnet relied on physical installation, infecting target systems when an infected configuration file carried by a USB stick was opened.
