            "description": "Calls made by a process to operating system-provided Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). These calls are essential for interacting with system resources such as memory, files, and hardware, or for performing system-level tasks. Monitoring these calls can provide insight into a process's intent, especially if the process is malicious.\n\n*Data Collection Measures:*\n\n- Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) Tools:\n    - Leverage tools to monitor API execution behaviors at the process level.\n    - Example: Sysmon Event ID 10 captures API call traces for process access and memory allocation.\n- Process Monitor (ProcMon):\n    - Use ProcMon to collect detailed logs of process and API activity. ProcMon can provide granular details on API usage and identify malicious behavior during analysis.\n- Windows Event Logs:\n    - Use Event IDs from Windows logs for specific API-related activities:\n        - Event ID 4688: A new process has been created (can indirectly infer API use).\n        - Event ID 4657: A registry value has been modified (to monitor registry-altering APIs).\n- Dynamic Analysis Tools:\n    - Tools like Cuckoo Sandbox, Flare VM, or Hybrid Analysis monitor API execution during malware detonation.\n- Host-Based Logs:\n    - On Linux/macOS systems, leverage audit frameworks (e.g., `auditd`, `strace`) to capture and analyze system call usage that APIs map to.\n- Runtime Monitors:\n    - Runtime security tools like Falco can monitor system-level calls for API execution.\n- Debugging and Tracing:\n    - Use debugging tools like gdb (Linux) or WinDbg (Windows) for deep tracing of API executions in real time.",
