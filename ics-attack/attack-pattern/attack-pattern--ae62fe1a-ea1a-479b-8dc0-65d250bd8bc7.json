(Citation: Guidance - IEC61131) POUs can be used to hold user programs written in IEC 61131-3 languages: Structured text, Instruction list, Function block, and Ladder logic. (Citation: Guidance - IEC61131) Application - 201203 They can also provide additional functionality, such as establishing connections between the PLC and other devices using TCON. (Citation: PLCBlaster - Spenneberg)\n  \nStuxnet uses a simple code-prepending infection technique to infect Organization Blocks (OB). For example, the following sequence of actions is performed when OB1 is infected  (Citation: Stuxnet - Symantec - 201102):\n*Increase the size of the original block.\n*Write malicious code to the beginning of the block.\n*Insert the original OB1 code after the malicious code.",
