Spearphishing attachments are different from other forms of spearphishing in that they employ malware attached to an email. All forms of spearphishing are electronically delivered and target a specific individual, company, or industry. In this scenario, adversaries attach a file to the spearphishing email and usually rely upon <span class=\"smw-format list-format \"><span class=\"smw-row\"><span class=\"smw-field\"><span class=\"smw-value\">User Execution</span></span></span></span> to gain execution and access.
