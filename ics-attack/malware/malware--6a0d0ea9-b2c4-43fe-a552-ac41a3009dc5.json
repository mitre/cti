It is similar to the IEC-104 module found in [Industroyer](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0604). Security researchers assess that [Industroyer2](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S1072) was designed to cause impact to high-voltage electrical substations. The initial [Industroyer2](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S1072) sample was compiled on 03/23/2022 and scheduled to execute on 04/08/2022, however it was discovered before deploying, resulting in no impact.(Citation: Industroyer2 Blackhat ESET)",
