This malware should not be confused with the \u201cSnake\u201d malware associated with the Turla group. The ICS processes documented within the malware\u2019s kill-list is similar to those defined by the MEGACORTEX software.(Citation: FireEye OT Ransomware July 2020)(Citation: Pylos January 2020)(Citation: Dragos EKANS June 2020)The ransomware was initially reported as \u201cSnake\u201d, however, to avoid confusion with the unrelated Turla APT group security researchers spelled it backwards as EKANS.",
