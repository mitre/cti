            "description": "[Operation Spalax](https://attack.mitre.org/campaigns/C0005) was a campaign that primarily targeted Colombian government organizations and private companies, particularly those associated with the energy and metallurgical industries. The [Operation Spalax](https://attack.mitre.org/campaigns/C0005) threat actors distributed commodity malware and tools using generic phishing topics related to COVID-19, banking, and law enforcement action. Security researchers noted indicators of compromise and some infrastructure overlaps with other campaigns dating back to April 2018, including at least one separately attributed to [APT-C-36](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0099), however identified enough differences to report this as separate, unattributed activity.(Citation: ESET Operation Spalax Jan 2021)  ",
