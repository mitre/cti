            "description": "[Versa Director Zero Day Exploitation](https://attack.mitre.org/campaigns/C0039) was conducted by [Volt Typhoon](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G1017) from early June through August 2024 as zero-day exploitation of Versa Director servers controlling software-defined wide area network (SD-WAN) applications. Since tracked as CVE-2024-39717, exploitation focused on credential capture from compromised Versa Director servers at managed service providers (MSPs) and internet service providers (ISPs) to enable follow-on access to service provider clients. [Versa Director Zero Day Exploitation](https://attack.mitre.org/campaigns/C0039) was followed by the delivery of the [VersaMem](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S1154) web shell for both credential theft and follow-on code execution.(Citation: Lumen Versa 2024)",
