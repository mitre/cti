            "description": "[Operation Wocao](https://attack.mitre.org/campaigns/C0014) was a cyber espionage campaign that targeted organizations around the world, including in Brazil, China, France, Germany, Italy, Mexico, Portugal, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The suspected China-based actors compromised government organizations and managed service providers, as well as aviation, construction, energy, finance, health care, insurance, offshore engineering, software development, and transportation companies.(Citation: FoxIT Wocao December 2019)\n\nSecurity researchers assessed the [Operation Wocao](https://attack.mitre.org/campaigns/C0014) actors used similar TTPs and tools as APT20, suggesting a possible overlap. [Operation Wocao](https://attack.mitre.org/campaigns/C0014) was named after an observed command line entry by one of the threat actors, possibly out of frustration from losing webshell access.(Citation: FoxIT Wocao December 2019)",
