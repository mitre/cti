Users may be subjected to social engineering to get them to click on a link that will lead to code execution.

Clicking on a link may also lead to other execution techniques such as exploitation of a browser or application vulnerability via [Exploitation for Client Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1203).
