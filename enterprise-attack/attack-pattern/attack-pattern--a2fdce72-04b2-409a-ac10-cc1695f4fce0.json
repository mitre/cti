A tool can be used for malicious purposes by an adversary, but (unlike malware) were not intended to be used for those purposes (ex: [PsExec](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0029)). \n\nAdversaries may obtain tools to support their operations, including to support execution of post-compromise behaviors. Tools may also be leveraged for testing \u2013 for example, evaluating malware against commercial antivirus or endpoint detection and response (EDR) applications.(Citation: Forescout Conti Leaks 2022)(Citation: Sentinel Labs Top Tier Target 2025)\n\nTool acquisition may involve the procurement of commercial software licenses, including for red teaming tools such as Cobalt Strike. In addition to freely downloading or purchasing software, adversaries may steal software and/or software licenses from third-party entities (including other adversaries). Threat actors may also crack trial versions of software.(Citation: Recorded Future Beacon 2019)",
