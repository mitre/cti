Custom certificates may be used in an attempt to intercept HTTPS traffic. \n\nSimilarly, adversaries may also listen for client devices sending probe requests for known or previously connected networks (Preferred Network Lists or PNLs). When a malicious access point receives a probe request, adversaries can respond with the same SSID to imitate the trusted, known network.(Citation: specter ops evil twin)  Victim devices are led to believe the responding access point is from their PNL and initiate a connection to the fraudulent network.\n\nUpon logging into the malicious Wi-Fi access point, a user may be directed to a fake login page or captive portal webpage to capture the victim\u2019s credentials. Once a user is logged into the fraudulent Wi-Fi network, the adversary may able to monitor network activity, manipulate data, or steal additional credentials. Locations with high concentrations of public Wi-Fi access, such as airports, coffee shops, or libraries, may be targets for adversaries to set up illegitimate Wi-Fi access points. ",
