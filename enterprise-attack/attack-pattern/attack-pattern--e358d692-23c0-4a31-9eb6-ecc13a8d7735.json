Functionality could exist within remote access tools to enable this, but utilities available on the operating system could also be used. \n\n### Windows\n\nExamples of tools and commands that acquire this information include \"ping\" or \"net view\" using [Net](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0039).\n\n### Mac\n\nSpecific to Mac, the <code>bonjour</code> protocol to discover additional Mac-based systems within the same broadcast domain. Utilities such as \"ping\" and others can be used to gather information about remote systems.\n\n### Linux\n\nUtilities such as \"ping\" and others can be used to gather information about remote systems.",
