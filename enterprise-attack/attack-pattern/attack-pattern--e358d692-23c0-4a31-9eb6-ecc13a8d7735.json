Functionality could exist within remote access tools to enable this, but utilities available on the operating system could also be used such as  [Ping](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0097) or <code>net view</code> using [Net](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0039). Adversaries may also use local host files (ex: <code>C:\\Windows\\System32\\Drivers\\etc\\hosts</code> or <code>/etc/hosts</code>) in order to discover the hostname to IP address mappings of remote systems. \n\nSpecific to macOS, the <code>bonjour</code> protocol exists to discover additional Mac-based systems within the same broadcast domain.",
