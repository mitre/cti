            "description": "Adversaries may attempt to get a listing of other systems by IP address, hostname, or other logical identifier on a network that may be used for Lateral Movement from the current system. Functionality could exist within remote access tools to enable this, but utilities available on the operating system could also be used such as  [Ping](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0097) or <code>net view</code> using [Net](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0039). Adversaries may also use local host files (ex: <code>C:\\Windows\\System32\\Drivers\\etc\\hosts</code> or <code>/etc/hosts</code>) in order to discover the hostname to IP address mappings of remote systems. \n\nSpecific to macOS, the <code>bonjour</code> protocol exists to discover additional Mac-based systems within the same broadcast domain.\n\nWithin IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) environments, remote systems include instances and virtual machines in various states, including the running or stopped state. Cloud providers have created methods to serve information about remote systems, such as APIs and CLIs. For example, AWS provides a <code>DescribeInstances</code> API within the Amazon EC2 API and a <code>describe-instances</code> command within the AWS CLI that can return information about all instances within an account.(Citation: Amazon Describe Instances API)(Citation: Amazon Describe Instances CLI) Similarly, GCP's Cloud SDK CLI provides the <code>gcloud compute instances list</code> command to list all Google Compute Engine instances in a project, and Azure's CLI <code>az vm list</code> lists details of virtual machines.(Citation: Google Compute Instances)(Citation: Azure VM List)",

Remote access tools with built-in features may interact directly with the Windows API to gather information.

Where possible, anomalous usage of these commands and APIs or the usage of these commands and APIs in conjunction with additional unexpected commands may be a sign of malicious use.
