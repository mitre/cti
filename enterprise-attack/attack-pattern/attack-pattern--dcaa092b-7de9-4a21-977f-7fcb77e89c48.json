            "description": "Windows uses access tokens to determine the ownership of a running process.  A user can manipulate access tokens to make a running process appear as though it belongs to someone other than the user that started the process.  When this occurs, the process also takes on the security context associated with the new token.  For example, Microsoft promotes the use of access tokens as a security best practice.  Administrators should log in as a standard user but run their tools with administrator privileges using the built-in access token manipulation command <code>runas</code>.  (Citation: Microsoft runas)\n  \nAdversaries may use access tokens to operate under a different user or system security context to perform actions and evade detection.   An adversary can use built-in Windows API functions to copy access tokens from existing processes; this is known as token stealing.  An adversary must already be in a privileged user context (i.e. administrator) to steal a token.  However, adversaries commonly use token stealing to elevate their security context from the administrator level to the SYSTEM level. (Citation: Pentestlab Token Manipulation)\n\nAdversaries can also create spoofed access tokens if they know the credentials of a user.  Any standard user can use the <code>runas</code> command, and the Windows API functions, to do this; it does not require access to an administrator account.\n\nLastly, an adversary can use a spoofed token to authenticate to a remote system as the account for that token if the account has appropriate permissions on the remote system.\n\nMetasploit\u2019s Meterpreter payload allows arbitrary token stealing and uses token stealing to escalate privileges.  (Citation: Metasploit access token)  The Cobalt Strike beacon payload allows arbitrary token stealing and can also create tokens.  (Citation: Cobalt Strike Access Token)\n\nDetection: If an adversary is using a standard command-line shell, analysts can detect token manipulation by auditing command-line activity.  Specifically, analysts should look for use of the <code>runas</code> command. Detailed command-line logging is not enabled by default in Windows. (Citation: Microsoft Command-line Logging)\n\nIf an adversary is using a payload that calls the Windows token APIs directly, analysts can detect token manipulation only through careful analysis of user network activity, examination of running processes, and correlation with other endpoint and network behavior.  \n\nThere are many Windows API calls a payload can take advantage of to manipulate access tokens (e.g., <code>LogonUser</code> (Citation: Microsoft LogonUser), <code>DuplicateTokenEx</code> (Citation: Microsoft DuplicateTokenEx), and <code>ImpersonateLoggedOnUser</code> (Citation: Microsoft ImpersonateLoggedOnUser)).  Please see the referenced Windows API pages for more information.\n\nPlatforms: Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2012, Windows XP, Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows Server 2003 R2, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Vista, Windows 8.1, Windows 10\n\nEffective Permissions: SYSTEM\n\nPermissions Required: User, Administrator\n\nContributors: Tom Ueltschi @c_APT_ure",
