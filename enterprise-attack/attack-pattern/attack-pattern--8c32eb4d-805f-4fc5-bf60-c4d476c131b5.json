This may be direct code execution, such as when a user opens a malicious executable delivered via [Spearphishing Attachment](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1193) with the icon and apparent extension of a document file. It also may lead to other execution techniques, such as when a user clicks on a link delivered via [Spearphishing Link](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1192) that leads to exploitation of a browser or application vulnerability via [Exploitation for Client Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1203). While User Execution frequently occurs shortly after Initial Access it may occur at other phases of an intrusion, such as when an adversary places a file in a shared directory or on a user's desktop hoping that a user will click on it.",
