For example, adversaries may add new network firewall rules to allow access to all internal network subnets without restrictions.(Citation: Exposed Fortinet Fortigate firewall interface leads to LockBit Ransomware)\n\nAdversaries may gain access to the firewall management console via [Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078) or by exploiting a vulnerability.
