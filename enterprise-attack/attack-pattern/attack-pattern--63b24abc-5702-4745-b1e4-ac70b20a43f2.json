            "description": "Threat actors may seek information/indicators from closed or open threat intelligence sources gathered about their own campaigns, as well as those conducted by other adversaries that may align with their target industries, capabilities/objectives, or other operational concerns. These reports may include descriptions of behavior, detailed breakdowns of attacks, atomic indicators such as malware hashes or IP addresses, timelines of a group\u2019s activity, and more. Adversaries may change their behavior when planning their future operations. \n\nAdversaries have been observed replacing atomic indicators mentioned in blog posts in under a week.(Citation: Google Cloud Threat Intelligence VMWare ESXi Zero-Day 2023) Adversaries have also been seen searching for their own domain names in threat vendor data and then taking them down, likely to avoid seizure or further investigation.(Citation: Sentinel One Contagious Interview ClickFix September 2025)\n\nThis technique is distinct from [Threat Intel Vendors](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1597/001) in that it describes threat actors performing reconnaissance on their own activity, not in search of victim information.
