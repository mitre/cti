This can be done to prepare for ransomware-related encryption, to perform [Lateral Movement](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0109), or as a precursor to [Direct Volume Access](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1006). \n\nOn ESXi systems, adversaries may use [Hypervisor CLI](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/012) commands such as `esxcli` to list storage connected to the host as well as `.vmdk` files.(Citation: TrendMicro)(Citation: TrendMicro ESXI Ransomware)\n\nOn Windows systems, adversaries can use `wmic logicaldisk get` to find information about local network drives. They can also use `Get-PSDrive` in PowerShell to retrieve drives and may additionally use Windows API functions such as `GetDriveType`.(Citation: Trend Micro MUSTANG PANDA PUBLOAD HIUPAN SEPTEMBER 2024)(Citation: Volexity)\n\nLinux has commands such as `parted`, `lsblk`, `fdisk`, `lshw`, and `df` that can list information about disk partitions such as size, type, file system types, and free space. The command `diskutil` on MacOS can be used to list disks while `system_profiler SPStorageDataType` can additionally show information such as a volume\u2019s mount path, file system, and the type of drive in the system. \n\nInfrastructure as a Service (IaaS) cloud providers also have commands for storage discovery such as `describe volume` in AWS, `gcloud compute disks list` in GCP, and `az disk list` in Azure.(Citation: AWS docs describe volumes)(Citation: GCP gcloud compute disks list)(Citation: azure az disk)",
