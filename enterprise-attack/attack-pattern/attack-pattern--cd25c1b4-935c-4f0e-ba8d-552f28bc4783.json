For example, adversaries may:\n\n* Leverage compute resources in order to mine cryptocurrency\n* Sell network bandwidth to proxy networks\n* Generate SMS traffic for profit\n* Abuse cloud-based messaging services to send large quantities of spam messages\n\nIn some cases, adversaries may leverage multiple types of Resource Hijacking at once.(Citation: Sysdig Cryptojacking Proxyjacking 2023)",
