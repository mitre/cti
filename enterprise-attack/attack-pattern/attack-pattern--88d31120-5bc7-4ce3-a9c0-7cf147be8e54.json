A variety of popular websites exist for adversaries to register for a web-based service that can be abused during later stages of the adversary lifecycle, such as during Command and Control ([Web Service](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1102)), [Exfiltration Over Web Service](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1567), or [Phishing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566). Using common services, such as those offered by Google, GitHub, or Twitter, makes it easier for adversaries to hide in expected noise.(Citation: FireEye APT29)(Citation: Hacker News GitHub Abuse 2024) By utilizing a web service, adversaries can make it difficult to physically tie back operations to them.",
