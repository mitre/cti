In 2017, a phishing campaign was used to target seven law and investment firms. (Citation: FireEye APT19) Some analysts track [APT19](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0073) and [Deep Panda](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0009) as the same group, but it is unclear from open source information if the groups are the same.
