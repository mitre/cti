[AppleJeus](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G1049) primarily targets the cryptocurrency industry and is most notably responsible for the [3CX Supply Chain Attack](https://attack.mitre.org/campaigns/C0057).(Citation: Mandiant 3cx UNC4736 2023) The group traditionally deploys malicious cryptocurrency software in combination with [Phishing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566).
