Defender perspective: monitoring for processes launched in a suspended state, followed by memory modifications (e.g., WriteProcessMemory targeting the PEB) that overwrite arguments before execution resumes. Detection also includes observing anomalous behaviors from processes whose logged arguments do not align with executed activity (e.g., network connections, file writes, or registry modifications).",
