            "description": "From a defender\u2019s perspective, suspicious bridging is observed when network devices begin allowing traffic that contradicts existing segmentation or access policies. Observable behaviors include sudden modifications to ACLs or firewall rules, unusual cross-boundary traffic flows (e.g., east-west communications across separated VLANs), or simultaneous ingress/egress anomalies. Multi-event correlation is key: configuration changes on a router/firewall followed by unexpected traffic patterns, especially from unusual sources, is a strong indicator of compromise.",
