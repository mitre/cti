Defenders may observe Docker build requests, anomalous Dockerfile instructions (such as downloading code from unknown IPs), or creation of new images followed by immediate deployment. This behavior chain typically consists of an unexpected image creation event correlated with outbound network communication to non-standard or untrusted destinations.",
