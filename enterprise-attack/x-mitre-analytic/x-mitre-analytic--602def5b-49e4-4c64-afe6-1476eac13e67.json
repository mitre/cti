            "description": "Defenders can detect suspicious cloud instance deletions by correlating events across authentication, instance lifecycle, and account activity. From a defender\u2019s perspective, behaviors of interest include instances deleted shortly after creation, deletions initiated by new or rarely used accounts, deletions following snapshot creation, and deletions originating from anomalous geolocations or access keys. These may indicate adversarial attempts to destroy forensic evidence or evade detection.",
