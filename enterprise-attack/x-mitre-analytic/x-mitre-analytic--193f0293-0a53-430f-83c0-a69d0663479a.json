            "description": "Defenders should monitor for anomalous or unauthorized changes to cloud compute configurations that alter quotas, tenant-wide policies, subscription associations, or allowed deployment regions. From a defender\u2019s perspective, suspicious behavior chains include a sudden increase in compute quota requests followed by new instance or resource creation, policy modifications that weaken security restrictions, or enabling previously unused/unsupported cloud regions. Correlation across identity, configuration, and subsequent provisioning logs is critical to distinguish legitimate administrative activity from adversarial abuse.",
