            "description": "Defenders can detect suspicious reversion of cloud compute instances by monitoring for unusual snapshot restores, rollback actions, or ephemeral storage resets that occur outside expected administrative workflows. From a defender\u2019s perspective, relevant detection chains include: a snapshot restore triggered by a new or rarely used account, a sequence of snapshot creation immediately followed by a restore and instance start, or rollbacks performed from anomalous geographic or network locations. These patterns may indicate attempts to remove forensic evidence or re-establish a clean execution state for persistence.",
