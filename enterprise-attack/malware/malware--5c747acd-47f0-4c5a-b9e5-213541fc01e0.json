[GoldMax](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0588) was discovered in early 2021 during the investigation into the [SolarWinds Compromise](https://attack.mitre.org/campaigns/C0024), and has likely been used by [APT29](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0016) since at least mid-2019. [GoldMax](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0588) uses multiple defense evasion techniques, including avoiding virtualization execution and masking malicious traffic.(Citation: MSTIC NOBELIUM Mar 2021)(Citation: FireEye SUNSHUTTLE Mar 2021)(Citation: CrowdStrike StellarParticle January 2022)",
