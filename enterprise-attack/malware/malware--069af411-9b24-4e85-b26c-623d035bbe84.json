            "description": "[Proxysvc](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0238) is a malicious DLL used by [Lazarus Group](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0032) in a campaign known as Operation GhostSecret. It has appeared to be operating undetected since 2017 and was mostly observed in higher education organizations. The goal of [Proxysvc](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0238) is to deliver additional payloads to the target and to maintain control for the attacker. It is in the form of a DLL that can also be executed as a standalone process. (Citation: McAfee GhostSecret)",
