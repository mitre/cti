Limit user access to system utilities such as systemctl to only users who have a legitimate need. Restrict read/write access to systemd unit files to only select privileged users who have a legitimate need to manage system services. Additionally, the installation of software commonly adds and changes systemd service unit files. Restrict software installation to trusted repositories only and be cautious of orphaned software packages. Utilize malicious code protection and application whitelisting to mitigate the ability of malware to create or modify systemd services. ",
