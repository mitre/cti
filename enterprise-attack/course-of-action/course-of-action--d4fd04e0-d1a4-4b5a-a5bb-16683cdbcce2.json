Deny direct remote access to internal systems through the use of network proxies, gateways, and firewalls. Disable or block remotely available services such as [Windows Remote Management](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1028). Use strong two-factor or multi-factor authentication for remote service accounts to mitigate an adversary's ability to leverage stolen credentials, but be aware of [Multi-Factor Authentication Interception](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1111) techniques for some two-factor authentication implementations.",
