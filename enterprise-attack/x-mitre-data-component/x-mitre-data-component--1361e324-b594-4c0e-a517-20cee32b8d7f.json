This action typically involves stopping a running instance, which halts its operation and releases certain associated resources, such as CPU and memory. Examples: \n\n- Google Cloud Platform (GCP): `instance.stop` events recorded in GCP Audit Logs indicate the deactivation of an instance.\n- Amazon Web Services (AWS): `StopInstances` actions in AWS CloudTrail indicate EC2 instances being stopped.\n- Microsoft Azure: `Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/deallocate` or `stop` events in Azure Activity Logs represent a virtual machine being stopped or deallocated.",
