This data component logs the opening or mounting of drives, capturing activities such as reading, writing, or executing files within an assigned drive letter (e.g., `C:\\`, `/mnt/drive`) or mount point. Examples: \n\n- Removable Drive Insertion: A USB drive is inserted, assigned the letter `F:\\`, and files are accessed.\n- Network Drive Mounting: A network share `\\\\server\\share` is mapped to the drive `Z:\\`.\n- External Hard Drive Access: An external drive is connected, mounted at `/mnt/backup`, and accessed for copying files.\n- System Volume Access: The system volume `C:\\` is accessed for modifications to critical files.\n- Cloud-Synced Drives: Cloud storage drives like OneDrive or Google Drive are accessed via local mounts.",
