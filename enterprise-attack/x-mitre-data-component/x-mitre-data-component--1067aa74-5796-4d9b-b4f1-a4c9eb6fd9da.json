This metadata is typically derived from interpreting scan results and helps build a profile of the targeted system. Examples: \n\n- Port and Service Details:\n    - Open ports (e.g., 22, 80, 443).\n    - Identified services running on those ports (e.g., SSH, HTTP, HTTPS).\n- Service Versions: Detected software version information (e.g., Apache 2.4.41, OpenSSH 8.2).\n- Operating System Information: OS fingerprinting data (e.g., Linux Kernel 5.4.0).\n- TLS/SSL Certificate Data: Information about the TLS/SSL certificate, such as the expiration date, issuer, and cipher suites.\n\n*Data Collection Measures:*\n\n- Scanning Tools:\n    - Nmap: Collects port, service, and version information using commands like nmap -sV <IP>.\n    - Masscan: High-speed scanning tool for discovering open ports and active services.\n    - Zmap: Focused on large-scale Internet scanning, collecting metadata about discovered services.\n    - Shodan API: Retrieves scan metadata for publicly exposed devices and services.\n- Network Logs:\n    - Use logs from firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), or intrusion prevention systems (IPS) to gather metadata from scan attempts. Example: Zeek or Suricata logs for incoming scan traffic.\n- OSINT Platforms: Platforms like Censys, GreyNoise, or Shodan provide aggregated metadata about Internet-facing resources.\n- Cloud Metadata Services: AWS Security Hub, Azure Monitor, or GCP Security Command Center can collect and centralize scan-related metadata for Internet-facing resources in cloud environments.",
