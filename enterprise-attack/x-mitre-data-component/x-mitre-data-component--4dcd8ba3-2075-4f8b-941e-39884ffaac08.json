Examples: \n\n- Drive Letter Reassignment: A USB drive previously assigned `E:\\` is reassigned to `D:\\` on a Windows machine.\n- Mount Point Change: On a Linux system, a mounted storage device at `/mnt/external` is moved to `/mnt/storage`.\n- Drive Permission Changes: A shared drive's permissions are modified to allow write access for unauthorized users or processes.\n- Renaming of a Drive: A network drive labeled \"HR_Share\" is renamed to \"Shared_Resources.\"\n- Modification of Cloud-Integrated Drives: A cloud storage mount such as Google Drive is modified to sync only specific folders.\n\nThis data component can be collected through the following measures:\n\nWindows Event Logs\n\n- Relevant Events:\n    - Event ID 98: Indicates changes to a volume (e.g., drive letter reassignment).\n    - Event ID 1006: Logs permission modifications or changes to removable storage.\n- Configuration: Enable \"Storage Operational Logs\" in the Event Viewer:\n`Applications and Services Logs > Microsoft > Windows > Storage-Tiering > Operational`\n\nLinux System Logs\n\n- Auditd Configuration: Add audit rules to track changes to mounted drives: `auditctl -w /mnt/ -p w -k drive_modification`\n- Command-Line Monitoring: Use `dmesg` or `journalctl` to observe drive modifications.\n\nmacOS System Logs\n\n- Unified Logs: Collect mount or drive modification events: `log show --info | grep \"Volume modified\"`\n- Command-Line Monitoring: Use `diskutil` to track changes:\n\nEndpoint Detection and Response (EDR) Tools\n\n- Configure policies in EDR solutions to monitor and log changes to drive configurations or attributes.\n\nSIEM Tools\n\n- Aggregate logs from multiple systems into a centralized platform like Splunk to correlate events and alert on suspicious drive modification activities.\n",
