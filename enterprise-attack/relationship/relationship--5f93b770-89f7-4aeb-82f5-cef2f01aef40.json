Windows event logs may designate activity associated with an adversary's attempt to remove access to an account:\r\nEvent ID 4723 - An attempt was made to change an account's password\r\nEvent ID 4724 - An attempt was made to reset an account's password\r\nEvent ID 4725 - A user account was disabled\r\n\r\nAlerting on these Event IDs may generate a high degree of false positives, so compare against baseline knowledge for how systems are typically used and correlate modification events with other indications of malicious activity where possible.",
