Service Control Manager spawning command shell is a good starting point. Add more suspicious relationships based on the reality of your network environment.\n\nIn order to reduce false positives, you can also filter the CommandLine event field using parameters such as /c which carries out the command specified by the parent process.\n\nAnalytic 1 - Service Execution\n\n<code>(source=\"*WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational\" EventCode=\"1\") OR (source=\"*WinEventLog:Security\" EventCode=\"4688\") | WHERE Image LIKE \"*services.exe\" AND Image LIKE \"*cmd.exe\"</code>",
