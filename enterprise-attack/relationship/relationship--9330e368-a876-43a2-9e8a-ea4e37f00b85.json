            "description": "Monitor for newly executed processes that may exploit software vulnerabilities in an attempt to elevate privileges. After gaining initial access to a system, threat actors attempt to escalate privileges as they may be operating within a lower privileged process which does not allow them to access protected information or carry out tasks which require higher permissions. A common way of escalating privileges in a system is by externally invoking and exploiting spoolsv or connhost executables, both of which are legitimate Windows applications. This query searches for an invocation of either of these executables by a user, thus alerting us of any potentially malicious activity.\n\nNote: Event IDs are for Sysmon (Event ID 1 - process create) and Windows Security Log (Event ID 4688 - a new process has been created). The Analytic is oriented around looking for an invocation of either spoolsv.exe or conhost.exe by a user, thus alerting us of any potentially malicious activity. A common way of escalating privileges in a system is by externally invoking and exploiting these executables, both of which are legitimate Windows applications. \n\nAnalytic 1 - Unusual Child Process for spoolsv.exe or connhost.exe\n\n<code> (source=\"*WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational\" EventCode=\"1\") OR (source=\"*WinEventLog:Security\" EventCode=\"4688\") (Image=\"C:\\Windows\\System32\\spoolsv.exe\" OR Image=\"C:\\Windows\\System32\\conhost.exe\") AND ParentImage= \"C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe\")</code>",
