            "description": "Users can be trained to identify social engineering techniques and spearphishing emails with malicious links which includes phishing for consent with OAuth 2.0. Additionally, users may perform visual checks of the domains they visit; however, homographs in ASCII and in IDN domains and URL schema obfuscation may render manual checks difficult. Use email warning banners to alert users when emails contain links from external senders, prompting them to exercise caution and reducing the likelihood of falling victim to spearphishing attacks. Phishing training and other cybersecurity training may raise awareness to check URLs before visiting the sites.",
