Other Windows API calls worth monitoring include EnumServicesStatusExA, which can be used to enumerate services in the service control manager database.\n\nNote: Most EDR tools do not support direct monitoring of API calls due to the sheer volume of calls produced by an endpoint but may have alerts or events that are based on abstractions of OS API calls. Dynamic malware analysis tools (i.e., sandboxes) can be used to trace the execution, including OS API calls, for a single PE binary.",
