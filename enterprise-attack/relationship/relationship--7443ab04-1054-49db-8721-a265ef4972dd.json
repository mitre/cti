Examples: one account logged into multiple systems simultaneously; multiple accounts logged into the same machine simultaneously; accounts logged in at odd times (ex: when the user is not present) or outside of business hours. Activity may be from interactive login sessions or process ownership from accounts being used to execute binaries on a remote system as a particular account. Correlate other security systems with login information (e.g., a user has an active login session but has not entered the building or does not have VPN access). Configure robust, consistent account activity audit policies across the enterprise and with externally accessible services.(Citation: TechNet Audit Policy)\n\nAnalytic 1 - Unusual logon patterns and times.\n\n<code>index=windows sourcetype=\"WinEventLog:Security\" \n(\n    (EventCode=4624 OR EventCode=4768) AND\n    Logon_Type=3 AND\n    NOT [search index=windows sourcetype=\"WinEventLog:Security\" EventCode=4768 | stats count by Account_Name | where count < 10 | fields Account_Name]\n) </code>",
