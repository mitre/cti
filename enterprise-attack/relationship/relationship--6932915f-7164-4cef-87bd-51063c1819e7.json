It is important to note that, in order to generate these events, a System Access Control List (SACL) must be defined for the ntds.dit file. Access rights that allow read operations on file objects and its attributes are %%4416 Read file data, %%4419 Read extended file attributes, %%4423 Read file attributes. If you search for just the name of the file and not the entire directory, you may get access events related to the ntds.dit file within a snapshot or volume shadow copy. \n\nEvents 4656 and 4663 (Microsoft Windows Security Auditing) provide context of processes and users creating or copying file objects (ObjectType = File) such as C:\\Windows\\NTDS\\ntds.dit.
