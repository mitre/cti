Data and events should not be viewed in isolation, but as part of a chain of behavior that could lead to other activities based on the information obtained.\nNormal, benign system and network events that look like cloud service discovery may be uncommon, depending on the environment and how they are used. Monitor cloud service usage for anomalous behavior that may indicate adversarial presence within the environment.",
