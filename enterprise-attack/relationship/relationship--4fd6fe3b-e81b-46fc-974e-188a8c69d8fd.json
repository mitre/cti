It allows for interactive access of the running windows, and forwards key presses, mouse clicks, etc. Network administrators, power users, and end-users may use RDP for day-to-day operations. From an adversary\u2019s perspective, RDP provides a means to\u00a0laterally move\u00a0to a new host. Determining which RDP connections correspond to adversary activity can be a difficult problem in highly dynamic environments, but will be useful in identifying the scope of a compromise.\nRemote Desktop can be detected in several ways\n\n- Network connections to port 3389/tcp (assuming use of the default port)\n- Packet capture analysis\n- Windows security logs (Event ID 4624, 4634, 4647, 4778)\n- Detecting network connections from\u00a0<code>mstsc.exe</code>\n- Execution of the process\u00a0<code>rdpclip.exe</code>\n- Runs as the clipboard manager on the RDP target if clipboard sharing is enabled\n\n<h4> Analytic 1 </h4>\n<code>rdp_start = filter flow_start where (port == \"3389\")\nrdp_end = filter flow_start where (port == \"3389\")\nrdp = group flow_start, flow_end by src_ip, src_port, dest_ip, dest_port </code>\n",
