The Analytic looks for the creation of a new CMSTP.exe process which initiates a network connection to a non-local IP address. This is a specific implementation where CMSTP.exe can be leveraged to setup listeners that will receive and install malware from remote sources in a trusted fashion.\n\nAnalytic 1 - CMSTP\n\n<code>(sourcetype=WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational EventCode=\"3\") Image=\"C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\CMSTP.exe\" | WHERE ((!cidrmatch(\"10.0.0.0/8\", SourceIp) AND !cidrmatch(\"192.168.0.0/16\", SourceIp) AND !cidrmatch(\"172.16.0.0/12\", SourceIp))</code>",
