Be aware of the search order Windows uses for executing or loading binaries and use fully qualified paths wherever appropriate.\n\nClean up old Windows Registry keys when software is uninstalled to avoid keys with no associated legitimate binaries. Periodically search for and correct or report path interception weaknesses on systems that may have been introduced using custom or available tools that report software using insecure path configurations.(Citation: Microsoft CreateProcess)(Citation: Microsoft Dynamic-Link Library Security)(Citation: Vulnerability and Exploit Detector)",
