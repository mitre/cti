These files include: <code>/etc/login.defs</code>,<code> /etc/securetty</code>,<code> /var/log/faillog</code>,<code> /var/log/lastlog</code>,<code> /var/log/tallylog</code>.\n- For MacOS, auditing frameworks that support capturing information on user logins, such as OSQuery, can be used to audit user account logins and authentications.
