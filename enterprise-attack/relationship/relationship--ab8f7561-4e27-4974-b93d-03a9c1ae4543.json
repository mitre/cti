            "description": "There are multiple methods of preventing a user's command history from being flushed to their .bash_history file, including use of the following commands:\n<code>set +o history</code> and <code>set -o history</code> to start logging again;\n<code>unset HISTFILE</code> being added to a user's .bash_rc file; and\n<code>ln -s /dev/null ~/.bash_history</code> to write commands to <code>/dev/null</code> instead.\n\nIn Zsh, `fc -p` can be used to create a private history session. However, previous history will be unavailable to the user until the session ends. Using `unset HISTFILE` and writing commands to `/dev/null` can also be used, similarly to Bash.\n\nIn PowerShell, users can utilize `Set-PSReadLineOption` to modify how commands are saved into history. Setting `-HistorySaveStyle SaveNothing` prevents command history from being saved onto the file. Note that setting it from `SaveNothing` to `SaveIncrementally` in the same session will cause all commands from that session to be saved. Alternatively, `-AddToHistoryHandler` can be used to filter certain commands from being saved into the history file.",
