            "description": "Monitor for user authentication attempts. From a classic Pass-The-Hash perspective, this technique uses a hash through the NTLMv1 / NTLMv2 protocol to authenticate against a compromised endpoint. This technique does not touch Kerberos. Therefore, NTLM LogonType 3 authentications that are not associated to a domain login and are not anonymous logins are suspicious. From an Over-Pass-The-Hash perspective, an adversary wants to exchange the hash for a Kerberos authentication ticket (TGT). One way to do this is by creating a sacrificial logon session with dummy credentials (LogonType 9) and then inject the hash into that session which triggers the Kerberos authentication process.",
