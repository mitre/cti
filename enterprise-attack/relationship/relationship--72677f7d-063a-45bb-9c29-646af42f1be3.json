Monitor for events associated with VB execution, such as Office applications spawning processes, usage of the Windows Script Host (typically cscript.exe or wscript.exe). VB execution is likely to perform actions with various effects on a system that may generate events, depending on the types of monitoring used.\n\nNote: This query monitors for the creation of processes like cscript.exe, wscript.exe, excel.exe, and winword.exe, which are commonly used to execute VB scripts. It highlights instances where these processes are initiated, providing insight into potential VB script execution.\n\nAnalytic 1 - Look for unusual VB process creation.\n\n<code>sourcetype=windows_security OR sourcetype=wineventlog OR sourcetype=linux_secure OR sourcetype=macos_secure\n| search (process=\"cscript.exe\" OR process=\"wscript.exe\" OR process=\"excel.exe\" OR process=\"winword.exe\")\n| eval suspicious_process=if(like(process, \"cscript.exe\" OR \"wscript.exe\" OR \"excel.exe\" OR \"winword.exe\"), \"Yes\", \"No\")\n| where suspicious_process=\"Yes\" </code>",
