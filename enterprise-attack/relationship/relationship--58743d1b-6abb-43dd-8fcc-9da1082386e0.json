These permissions can be defined within a particular namespace or within cluster-scoped resources. Securing the Docker daemon can be done by using SSH or TLS with certificate authorization. Container management tools such as Docker and Podman may offer ways to run containers as rootless, which prevents them from running with privileged permissions.",
