The Analytic looks for command-line instances of searching the Windows Registry for insecurely stored credentials. This can be accomplished using the query functionality of the [Reg](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0075) system utility, by looking for keys and values that contain strings such as \u201cpassword\u201d. In addition, adversaries may use toolkits such as\u00a0[PowerSploit](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0194)  in order to dump credentials from various applications such as IIS. Accordingly, this analytic looks for invocations of reg.exe in this capacity as well as that of several PowerSploit modules with similar functionality.\n\nAnalytic 1 - Credentials in Files & Registry\n\n<code>(source=\"WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational\" EventCode=\"1\") OR (source=\"WinEventLog:Security\" EventCode=\"4688\")  \nCommandLine=\"*reg* query HKLM /f password /t REG_SZ /s*\" OR\nCommandLine=\"reg* query HKCU /f password /t REG_SZ /s\" OR\nCommandLine=\"*Get-UnattendedInstallFile*\" OR\nCommandLine=\"*Get-Webconfig\" OR\nCommandLine=\"*Get-ApplicationHost*\" OR\nCommandLine=\"*Get-SiteListPassword*\" OR\nCommandLine=\"*Get-CachedGPPPassword*\" OR\nCommandLine=\"*Get-RegistryAutoLogon*\"</code>",
