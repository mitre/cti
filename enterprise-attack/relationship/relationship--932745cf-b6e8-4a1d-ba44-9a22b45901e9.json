If a newly created or modified runs as a service, it may indicate APT activity. However, services are frequently installed by legitimate software. A well-tuned baseline is essential to differentiating between benign and malicious service modifications. Look for events where a file was created and then later run as a service. In these cases, a new service has been created or the binary has been modified. Many programs, such as\u00a0msiexec.exe, do these behaviors legitimately and can be used to help validate legitimate service creations/modifications.\n\n<h4>Analytic 1 - Service Binary Modifications</h4>\n<code>legitimate_installers = [\"C:\\windows\\system32\\msiexec.exe\", \"C:\\windows\\syswow64\\msiexec.exe\", ...]\n\nfile_change = search File:Create,Modify\nprocess = search Process:Create\nservice_process = filter processes where (parent_exe == \"services.exe\")\nmodified_service = join (search, filter) where (\n file_change.time < service_process.time and\n file_change.file_path == service_process.image_path\n)\n\nmodified_service = filter modified_service where (modified_service.file_change.image_path not in legitimate_installers)\noutput modified_service</code>",
