They manipulated scheduled tasks by updating an existing legitimate task to execute their tools and then returned the scheduled task to its original configuration. [APT29](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0016) also created a scheduled task to maintain [SUNSPOT](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0562) persistence when the host booted.(Citation: Volexity SolarWinds)(Citation: FireEye SUNBURST Backdoor December 2020)(Citation: CrowdStrike SUNSPOT Implant January 2021)",
