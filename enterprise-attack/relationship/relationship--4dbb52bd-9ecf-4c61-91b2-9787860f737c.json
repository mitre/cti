For example, in Azure AD environments configure alerts to notify when accounts have gone many days without using privileged roles, as these roles may be able to be removed.(Citation: Microsoft Security Alerts for Azure AD Roles) Consider using temporary, just-in-time (JIT) privileged access to Azure AD resources rather than permanently assigning privileged roles.(Citation: Microsoft Azure security baseline for Azure Active Directory)",
