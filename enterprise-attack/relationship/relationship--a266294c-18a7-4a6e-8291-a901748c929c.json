Follow best practices for design and administration of an enterprise network to limit privileged account use across administrative tiers.\n\n###Linux\nScraping the passwords from memory requires root privileges. Follow best practices in restricting access to privileged accounts to avoid hostile programs from accessing such sensitive regions of memory.",
