The adversary could then obtain SMS messages or hijack phone calls intended for someone else [[Citation: Betanews-Simswap]]. One use case is intercepting authentication messages or phone calls to obtain illicit access to online banking or other online accounts [[Citation: Guardian-Simswap]].\n\nPlatforms: Android, iOS",
