The devastating nature of the items and/or information found can be anything from medical records, resumes, personal photos and emails, bank statements, account details or information about software, tech support logs and so much more, including hardware devices. By collecting this information an adversary may be able to learn important facts about the person or organization that play a role in helping the adversary in their attack.",
