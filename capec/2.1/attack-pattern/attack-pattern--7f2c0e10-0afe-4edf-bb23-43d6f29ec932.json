Often this is metadata about the file, such as a cached thumbnail for an image file. Unless utilities are invoked in a particular way, this data is not visible during the normal use of the file. It is possible for an attacker to store malicious data or code using these facilities, which would be difficult to discover.", "external_references": [{"source_name": "capec", "url": "https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/636.html", "external_id": "CAPEC-636"}, {"source_name": "ATTACK", "description": "Data Obfuscation:Steganography", "url": "https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1001/002", "external_id": "T1001.002"}, {"source_name": "ATTACK", "description": "Signed Binary Proxy Execution:Compiled HTML File", "url": "https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1218/001", "external_id": "T1218.001"}, {"source_name": "reference_from_CAPEC", "description": "Means, Ryan L., Alternate Data Streams: Out of the Shadows and into the Light, SANS Institute", "url": "https://www.giac.org/paper/gcwn/230/alternate-data-streams-shadows-light/104234", "external_id": "REF-493"}], "object_marking_refs": ["marking-definition--17d82bb2-eeeb-4898-bda5-3ddbcd2b799d"], "x_capec_abstraction": "Standard", "x_capec_child_of": ["attack-pattern--f8533ce1-5f23-4660-8f70-1a05af2c70d3"], "x_capec_parent_of": ["attack-pattern--0d2d1e18-6e28-4c58-b442-c5450e6c1112", "attack-pattern--9a7c6cbc-e3f9-4925-992e-f07e1359de87"], "x_capec_prerequisites": ["The operating system must support a file system that allows for alternate data storage for a file."], "x_capec_status": "Draft", "x_capec_typical_severity": "High", "x_capec_version": "3.5"}]}
