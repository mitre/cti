Phishing is essentially a form of information gathering or \"fishing\" for information.",

The link in the e-mail looks very similar to that of his bank and once the link is clicked, the log in page is the exact replica. John supplies his login credentials after which he is notified that his account has now been unlocked and that everything is fine. An attacker has just collected John's online banking information which can now be used by him or her to log into John's bank account and transfer John's money to a bank account of the attackers' choice."
