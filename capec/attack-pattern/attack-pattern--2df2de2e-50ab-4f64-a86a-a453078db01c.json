    "description": "Attacks on session IDs and resource IDs take advantage of the fact that some software accepts user input without verifying its authenticity. For example, a message queuing system that allows service requesters to post messages to its queue through an open channel (such as anonymous FTP), authorization is done through checking group or role membership contained in the posted message. However, there is no proof that the message itself, the information in the message (such group or role membership), or indeed the process that wrote the message to the queue are authentic and authorized to do so.\nMany server side processes are vulnerable to these attacks because the server to server communications have not been analyzed from a security perspective or the processes \"trust\" other systems because they are behind a firewall. In a similar way servers that use easy to guess or spoofable schemes for representing digital identity can also be vulnerable. Such systems frequently use schemes without cryptography and digital signatures (or with broken cryptography). Session IDs may be guessed due to insufficient randomness, poor protection (passed in the clear), lack of integrity (unsigned), or improperly correlation with access control policy enforcement points.\nExposed configuration and properties files that contain system passwords, database connection strings, and such may also give an attacker an edge to identify these identifiers.\nThe net result is that spoofing and impersonation is possible leading to an attacker's ability to break authentication, authorization, and audit controls on the system.",

        "Thin client applications like web applications are particularly vulnerable to session ID attacks. Since the server has very little control over the client, but still must track sessions, data, and objects on the server side, cookies and other mechanisms have been used to pass the key to the session data between the client and server. When these session keys are compromised it is trivial for an attacker to impersonate a user's session in effect, have the same capabilities as the authorized user. There are two main ways for an attacker to exploit session IDs.\nA brute force attack involves an attacker repeatedly attempting to query the system with a spoofed session header in the HTTP request. A web server that uses a short session ID can be easily spoofed by trying many possible combinations so the parameters session-ID= 1234 has few possible combinations, and an attacker can retry several hundred or thousand request with little to no issue on their side.\nThe second method is interception, where a tool such as wireshark is used to sniff the wire and pull off any unprotected session identifiers. The attacker can then use these variables and access the application."
