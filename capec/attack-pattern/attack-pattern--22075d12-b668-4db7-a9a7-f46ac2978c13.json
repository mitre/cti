Once the user successfully authenticates to the target software, the attacker uses the (now privileged) session identifier in their own transactions. This attack leverages the fact that the target software either relies on client-generated session identifiers or maintains the same session identifiers after privilege elevation.",

Session fixation is possible since the application server does not regenerate session identifiers when there is a change in the privilege levels. See also: CVE-2004-2182"
