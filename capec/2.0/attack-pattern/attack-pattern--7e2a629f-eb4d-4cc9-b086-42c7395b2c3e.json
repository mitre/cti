The path to the reports directory may be something like web/username/reports. If the username is supplied via a hidden field, an adversary could insert a bogus username such as ../../../../../WINDOWS. If the adversary needs to remove the trailing string /reports, then they can simply insert enough characters so the string is truncated. Alternatively the adversary might apply the postfix NULL character (%00) to determine whether this terminates the string.</xhtml:p>\n               <xhtml:p>Different forms of NULL to think about include</xhtml:p>\n               <xhtml:div style=\"margin-left:1em;\" class=\"informative\">PATH%00PATH[0x00]PATH[alternate representation of NULL character]<script></script>%00</xhtml:div>\n            ",

The request must be made to a web server that truncates the request at the null byte (%00), otherwise an invalid file name is specified and a \"file not found\" page will be returned. Example web servers that truncate the requested URI include Microsoft IIS and Netscape Enterprise. Though the requested URI is truncated for the purposes of locating the file the long string is still passed to the Adobe ActiveX component responsible for rendering the page. This in turn triggers a buffer overflow within RTLHeapFree() allowing for an adversary to overwrite an arbitrary word in memory. The responsible instructions from RTLHeapFree() are shown here:</xhtml:p>\n               <xhtml:div style=\"margin-left:1em;\" class=\"informative\">0x77F83AE5 MOV EAX,[EDI+8]0x77F83AE8 MOV ECX,[EDI+C]...0x77F83AED MOV [ECX],EAX</xhtml:div>\n               <xhtml:p>The register EDI contains a pointer to a user-supplied string. The adversary therefore has control over both the ECX and EAX registers used in the shown MOV instruction.</xhtml:p>\n               <xhtml:p>Successful exploitation allows remote adversaries to utilize the arbitrary word overwrite to redirect the flow of control and eventually take control of the affected system. Code execution will occur under the context of the user that instantiated the vulnerable version of Adobe Acrobat.</xhtml:p>\n               <xhtml:p>An adversary does not need to establish a malicious web site as exploitation can occur by adding malicious content to the end of any embedded link and referencing any Microsoft IIS or Netscape Enterprise web server.

This includes initial injected instructions as well as certain overwritten addresses. This increases the complexity of successful exploitation.
